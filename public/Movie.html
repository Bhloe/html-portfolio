    <h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 favorite movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Woman King</h3>
    <p>
      This is a terrific film in almost all respects. I actually rate it 4.5
      stars but give it 5 in response to the handful of dumbbells who gave it 1
      without reading or else misread their history. Viola Davis is amazingly
      good as General Nanisca, the leader of Dahomey's all-female Agojie
      warriors, who may have been the most formidable fighting force, male or
      female, in African history along with the Zulus. Thuso Mbedo is also
      amazingly good as Nawi, the young Dahomeyan woman too headstrong to get
      the Crown of Woman King.

    <h3>Wednesday</h3>

      ednesday is an American coming-of-age supernatural comedy horror
      television series based on the character Wednesday Addams by Charles

    <h3>Inventing Anna</h3>
    <p>
      A journalist with a lot to prove investigates the case of Anna Delvey, the
      Instagram-legendary German heiress who stole the hearts of New York's
      social scene - and stole their money as well.
