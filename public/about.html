    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Precious Onyemaechi, a female, a sister, a lover, a friend, and
      a daughter. I am 25 years old. This year has really proved to be a turning
      point in my life. I am currently a graduate with a Degree in Estate
      Management and valuation. This year, 2023, is supposed to be my service
      year and i chose to use it to invest in myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked an online course on Udemy and i gave myself to it for the next
      few months after that. Now, i am a Full Stack Web Developer and can take
      on any Web Development Project no matter the magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming a Web Developer was one of the best decisions i have ever made.
      Of course i did not achieve it all by myself. I had loved ones who stood
      behind me and helped me believe in myself. I owe my success to God for
      bringing such lovely species of humans my way.

      Anyway, enough about me. You can contact me by literally clicking on the
      contact me link. Let's get to know each other or just do business. I'm
      available. *wink*.
